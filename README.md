PokedexInt
  A first attempt at a Pokedex. The project contains a limited max stat calculator as well. The project was made for a class, so 
    many comments are requirements for submission. Instead of building the files into a database, I created wrappers to read 
    the .csv files into a stream, then parse the stream into useable values. It worked, but it took too long, and the project wound 
    up being smaller than I had intended. I have no plans to come back and update this project. I instead intend to take what I 
    learned into the next one, and make my next project better.
